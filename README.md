# Churn-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn using various classification algorithms. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue using a service, empowering businesses to take proactive retention measures.


## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer-level data, including demographics, service usage metrics, and churn labels. Features are preprocessed and engineered before feeding into various models.

> **Note:** The dataset appears to be derived from the **Bank Customer Churn** dataset.
